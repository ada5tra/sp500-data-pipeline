This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end data pipeline for processing S&P 500 data using AWS S3, Snowflake, Python, and Terraform. The pipeline extracts raw data, transforms it, and loads it into Snowflake for analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Snowflake account
- AWS account with access to S3
- Terraform (if using for infrastructure)

## Folder Structure

- `data/` - Contains raw and processed data files.
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for data loading, cleaning, and transformation.
- `terraform/` - Terraform configuration for infrastructure setup.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ada5tra/sp500-data-pipeline.git

# Part 1. S&P 500 Docker & Kubernetes Setup (08/01/2025)
Overview

This project explores various tools and platforms to work with the S&P 500 dataset. The goal is to use these tools to create ETL pipelines, run exploratory data analysis (EDA), and develop various other models and applications. The platform stack includes Docker, Kubernetes, and other open-source tools for managing the dataset and performing data processing tasks.
Technologies

    Docker: Containerisation platform for running and managing applications in isolated environments.
    Kubernetes: Open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    Python: Programming language used for data analysis and manipulation.
    Minikube: Tool to run Kubernetes clusters locally.
    Helm: Package manager for Kubernetes, simplifying deployment and management of applications.
    Plotly: Interactive graphing library for visualising the S&P 500 data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

    Docker: Install Docker
    Minikube: Install Minikube
    Kubectl: Install kubectl
    Helm: Install Helm

## Step 1: Docker Setup

    Dockerfile: This file defines the container image, installs necessary dependencies, and copies the project files into the container.

    Building the Docker Image: Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the project directory.

    Running the Docker Container: Run the Docker container, making sure to map the necessary volumes for the data and exposing ports as required.

## Step 2: Kubernetes Setup

    Kubernetes Deployment Configuration (financial-analysis-deployment.yaml): This configuration file deploys the application as a pod in the Kubernetes cluster.

    Kubernetes Service Configuration (financial-analysis-service.yaml): This file defines the service that exposes your application externally.

    Running Minikube: Start Minikube to create a local Kubernetes cluster.

    Deploying to Kubernetes: Deploy your Kubernetes resources using the configuration files (eda-deployment.yaml and sp500-eda.yaml).

## Step 3: Visualising Data

This project generates various visualisations from the S&P 500 dataset. You can view the following visualisation files:

    fig1.html
    fig2.html
    fig3.html

These files display interactive charts created using Plotly.

## Files Explained

    Dockerfile: Defines the image used to build the container for the application. Installs dependencies and copies the necessary files into the image.

    requirements.txt: Lists the Python packages that need to be installed inside the Docker container, including pandas, numpy, and plotly.

    SP500_Docker.py: Contains the logic for processing the S&P 500 dataset. This script loads the data, performs exploratory data analysis, and generates visual outputs.

    eda-deployment.yaml: Kubernetes deployment configuration that defines how the application should run on Kubernetes.

    sp500-eda.yaml: Kubernetes service configuration that exposes the deployed application to external access.

    docker-compose.yml (optional): A simple setup to run multi-container applications locally using Docker Compose.

    fig1.html, fig2.html, fig3.html: Output files from exploratory data analysis. They may contain visual representations of the dataset and other data insights.

## Next Steps

While this project is still under development, here are some tasks for the future:

    Enhance Data Processing: Expand the data processing script to include more complex analyses such as financial modeling, machine learning, and sentiment analysis of the data.

    Build ETL Pipelines: Create an ETL pipeline to automate the process of collecting, transforming, and loading financial data.

    Integrate More Tools: Continue exploring and integrating tools like Airflow, dbt, and Terraform for more complex workflows, automation, and infrastructure as code.

    Add CI/CD: Implement a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to streamline testing and deployment.

    Complete the Python script (SP500_Docker.py) to perform ETL tasks and analyse the S&P 500 dataset.
    Expand your Kubernetes setup to handle more complex workflows.
    Integrate additional tools and platforms for enhanced data processing and analysis.

# Part 2. S&P 500 Data Pipeline Project (09/01/2025)

This project demonstrates how to set up a Snowflake data pipeline using AWS S3 as a staging area for loading data.

## Files and Scripts

- `data/sp500_data.csv`: Example S&P 500 data (this file is hosted on AWS S3).
- `scripts/create_stage.sql`: SQL to create a Snowflake stage linked to the S3 bucket.
- `scripts/create_table.sql`: SQL to create the table in Snowflake for storing the data.
- `scripts/data_loading.sql`: SQL to load the data from the stage into the table.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.

2. Set up your own Snowflake instance and S3 bucket.

3. Run the SQL scripts in order:
- `create_stage.sql`
- `create_table.sql`
- `data_loading.sql`

4. Ensure the AWS credentials and S3 bucket information are correctly configured in the Snowflake stage creation script.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add additional data transformations.
- Integrate with a data pipeline tool (e.g., Airflow, dbt) for automated ETL.
