# S&P 500 Data Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end data pipeline for processing S&P 500 data using AWS S3, Snowflake, Python, and Terraform. The pipeline extracts raw data, transforms it, and loads it into Snowflake for analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Snowflake account
- AWS account with access to S3
- Terraform (if using for infrastructure)

## Folder Structure

- `data/` - Contains raw and processed data files.
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for data loading, cleaning, and transformation.
- `terraform/` - Terraform configuration for infrastructure setup.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sp500-data-pipeline.git
